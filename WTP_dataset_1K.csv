Veterans from the time of the United States Revolution through World War I had legal access to cannabis but in 1942 due to the efforts of a handful of powerful men cannabis was removed from the United States Formulary. Modern science has shown us that the human body makes it's own cannabis like substances called cannabinoids and that these cannabinoids are shown to be involved in various functions throughout the body like pain and anxiety. Marijuana works with this natural body system to ease the symptoms of PTSD giving disabled Veterans a big improvement in their quality of life. We owe our disabled Veterans our freedom, the least we should do is treat their pain and PTSD.",We the people ask the federal government to Change an existing Administration policy:,Health Care,8261,,September,25.0,2011.0,25-Sep-11,25-Sep-11

Lyme can lead to chronic and debilitating effects if not properly treated. Lyme is leaving masses of people in progressive states of illness and financial ruin.

This is not true. Insurance companies are denying payments for medications even when deemed medically necessary after 30 days. Doctors who treat Lyme patients are being investigated and prosecuted for not conforming to such guidelines.

The seal was well preserved in Korea until the Korean War. It was stolen by U.S. soldiers during the war, in 1950, and was illegally taken out of the country.
After the theft, the Korean government notified its U.S. counterpart that 47 royal seals had been stolen by U.S. troops and made this incident public in the U.S. through the media including the Baltimore Sun.
We have recently perused the U.S. State Department records to find the investigation by the State Department that recognized the Joseon royal seals as stolen articles.

No one wants to go through the trouble to import a non standard automobile, except enthusiasts and collectors.  By opening up the import restrictions to 10 model years it will give consumers a wider range of vehicular choices, especially in today's inflated used car market (no thanks to Cash for Clunkers).

Fast track would allow the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership to leapfrog customary legislative protocol and be put to a rapid ""up or down"" vote without a public hearing, floor debate, or amendments. Forcing Congress to vote on an agreement this complex without adequate time for open hearings, review, and public scrutiny, sets a dangerous precedent. For three years, a group of some 600 multinational corporations and trade associations have been quietly negotiating a trade pact IN SECRET that could void American laws that protect workers, jobs, health, and the environment.

It's about the GENOCIDE of the WHITE RACE.,"A talk show host said recently, ""Immigration reform is not about race but about the rule of law.""
No. It's about race. Massive third world immigration into White countries, legal or illegal, is WHITE GENOCIDE.
ALL White countries and ONLY White countries are being flooded with non-whites, and Whites are forced to integrate with them so as to ""assimilate,"" i.e. intermarry and be blended out of existence.
Mass immigration and forced assimilation is genocide in Tibet, and it's genocide in White countries, by UN Convention:
“Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.”
The enforcers of White Genocide say they're anti-racist. What they are is anti-White.

Popcorn won the vote, but then POTUS revealed that both turkeys would be allowed to live. Is this the democracy the pilgrims fought and ate dinner for? We think not.

G fund (money market), F fund (fixed income), C fund (S&P 500 Index), S fund (small cap index), and the I fund (International).  Unfortunately, in a falling stock market, participants are NOT ABLE to benefit as the players on Wall Street can.
Inverse Funds would be the fund asset that helps significantly to level the playing field with Wall Street.  For example, if the C fund were to fall in price by 5% over the course of a month, then the inverse fund to it (call it -C, let's say) would rise in price by 5% during the same timeframe.  Inverse funds could be created for the F, S, and I funds as well.

For each full day during long-term TDY of 31 to 180 days, the rate would be 75 percent of the locality rate (lodging plus meals and incidentals); for travel lasting more than 180 days, it would fall to 55 percent of the locality rate for each full day. Additionally incidental travel expenses have already been expanded further burdening the government worker.
This will inevitably lower morale and decrease voluntary travel to support the war fighter. Government workers have families and loved ones that they support and leave during the expected and necessary times of travel and should not be incurring additional expenditures for that support.",null,Homeland Security & Defense,737,,October,25.0,2014.0,25-Oct-14,25-Oct-14
